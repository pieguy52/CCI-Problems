I: Two numbers are represented as linked lists in reverse order. Add them together and return the sum.
D: The solution will be a sum representing the sum of the linked lists as a linked list
	Sub 1: The given example is 7>1>6 + 5>9>2 (617 + 295) which equals 2>1>9 (912)
	Sub 2: Take the value of each node add them together to any carry over, put that in a new node, and update the carry over. At the end make a node for the carry over if necessary
	Sub 3: Take care of carry overs and unbalanced lists 
	Sub 4: 7 + 5 is 12, first node is 2 carry over is 1. 1 + 9 + 1 is 11, second node is 1 carry over is 1. 6 + 2 + 1 is 9, the final node is 9.
	Sub 5: When translating to code taking care of unbalanced lists is key, as otherwise the sum wont return correctly. Taking care of the carry over both during the summations 
	and any that are left at the end is also important.
	Sub 6: Multiple tests were run with key tests being 9>9 + 1 and 9>9>9 and 1.
	Sub 7: No debugging was necessary
L: When dealing with multiple lists it is important to keep track of their length to avoid null pointer exceptions.
