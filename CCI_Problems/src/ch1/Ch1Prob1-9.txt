I:Given two strings, s1 and s2, check if s2 is a rotation of s1.
D:The solution will be a boolean, as to whether or not s2 is a rotaiton of s1.
	Sub 1: The given example was waterbottle and erbottlewat.
	Sub 2: If s2 is rotated, it can be checked if it equals s1. 
	Sub 3: The checking sequence will only ever take the length of s1 to check every possible rotation to check whether or not the strings are the same.
	Sub 4: Rotate erbottlewat to rbottlewate, rbottlewate != waterbottle. Rotate rbottlewate to bottlewater, bottlewater != waterbottle ... 
	Rotate ewaterbottl to waterbottle, waterbottle == waterbottle, return true.
	Sub 5: The translation to code is one to one, using a string builder to make the rotations by deleting the charcter at the front of the string and moving
	it to the back of the string. If the two strings are the same it returns true, otherwise it continues on.
	Sub 6: By handleing null and strings of different lenghts, all tests passed wihhout issue.
	Sub 7: No debbuging was necassary as the algorithm worked fine as is.
L: The problme mentions using a isSubtring mehtod, and only being able to use it once. The idea was probable to locate a substring inside the rotated string and
comparing that to a substring in the original. That was wholly unecassary as rotating s2 to match s1, or vise versa, results in an easier to implement soluiton that
also makes more sense. This problem reminds that some problems may have extra information that may seem helpful but could be unnecassary or unhelpful.
